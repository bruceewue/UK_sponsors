# uk_licensed_sponsors

This project aims to provide a convenient way to fetch and store data about companies eligible for "skilled worker" sponsorship. The data is retrieved twice a day using GitHub Actions and saved in the JSON file format. The JSON files in the repository will only be updated when the source file is updated. This allows other applications, such as a Chrome extension, to make requests and utilize the data.
